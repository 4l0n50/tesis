Groups where the DDH assumption (as well as the discrete logarithm assumption) is believed to be hard were usually constructed as multiplicative subgroups of a finite field of order $n$, $\mathbb{F}_n$ -- for example the set of {quadratic residues} of $\Z_p$ when $p$ is a safe prime (i.e. $(p-1)/2$ is also a prime number).
Koblitz and (independently) Miller proposed as an alternative the usage of \emph{elliptic curves} over $\mathbb{F}_n$ \cite{MOC:Koblitz87,C:Miller85}, that is the set of points $(x,y)$ over $\mathbb{F}_n^2$ which are solutions to the equation $E:y^2=x^3+ax+b$, where $a,b\in\mathbb{F}_n$, together with an especial point $\mathcal{O}$. The solutions to $E$ together with $\mathcal{O}$ form an abelian group, denoted by $E(\mathbb{F}_n)$, where $\mathcal{O}$ is the identity element and the group operation is defined as a geometrical operation between the group elements (called the cord-and-tangent method). For the appropriate choice of $a$ and $b$ the discrete logarithm is believed to require exponential time to be computed, while for subgroups of $\mathbb{F}_n$  there are known sub-exponential attacks. As consequence, the size of the elements of $E(\mathbb{F}_n)$ is much smaller than the size of elements of traditional finite fields at an equivalent security level.

However not all elliptic curves offer the same security. For example in some elliptic curves, which we will call bilinear groups for short, one can compute the \emph{Weil pairing} or the \emph{Tate pairing}. These {pairings} are functions of the form $e:\GG_1\times\GG_2\to\GG_T$ where $\GG_1$ and $\GG_2$ are cyclic subgroups of $E(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\GG_T$ is another cyclic group known as the \emph{target group}. The function $e$ is {bilinear}, because $e(a\mathcal{X},b\mathcal{Y})=ab\cdot e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ for any $\mathcal{X}\in\GG_1$ and any $\mathcal{Y}\in\GG_2$, and {non-degenerate}, because $e(\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2)$ is a generator of $\GG_T$ when $\mathcal{P}_s$ is a generator of $\GG_s$, $s\in\{1,2\}$. For simplicity assume that $\GG_1=\GG_2=\GG$ (this is the case of the Weil pairing) and let $\mathcal{P}$ the generator of $\GG$. Intuitively, the function $e$ is ``solving CDH in $\GG$ but giving the answer in $\GG_T$'', that is, given $\mathcal{X}=a\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Y}:=b\mathcal{P}$ one can compute $t=e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=ab\cdot e(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{P})$. Although this does not gives a solution to the CDH problem in $\GG$, it does solve the DDH problem in $\GG$. Indeed, $e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=e(\mathcal{Z},\mathcal{P})$ is satisfied by $\mathcal{Z}=ab\mathcal{P}$ but only with negligible probability by a random element of $\GG$. 
Moreover, the MOV and the FR reductions compile the DL problem in $E(\mathbb{F}_n)$ into the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{n^\alpha}$, for some $\alpha$ known as the {embedding degree}, where known sub-exponential algorithms for solving the DL exist \cite{STOC:MenVanOka91,MOC:FreRuc94}.
For these reasons elliptic curves where a pairing function can be efficiently computed were initially considered unsafe for cryptographic purposes.

But this changed with the work of Joux \cite{ANTS:Joux00}, where he showed that pairings can be also used to construct cryptographic schemes rather than to destroy them. Joux noted that pairings can be used to construct a non-interactive three party Diffie-Hellman key exchange \cite{ANTS:Joux00}. Given public keys $\mathcal{X}=x\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{Y}=y\mathcal{P}$, and $\mathcal{Z}=z\mathcal{P}$ and one secret key from $x,y,$ or $z$, each party can compute the shared key $x\cdot e(\mathcal{Y},\mathcal{Z})= y\cdot e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Z})= z\cdot e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=xyz\cdot e(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{P})$. The critical observation was that, although the DDH might be easy in bilinear groups, the DL might be made hard if the size of the group is appropriately increased in order to rule out the sub-exponential attacks implied by the MOV and FR reductions. Moreover, Joux protocol can be proven secure under the \emph{bilinear decisional Diffie-Hellman} assumption, which is believed to be a hard problem in some bilinear groups \cite{C:BonFra01}, and also CDH and many other assumptions are believed to hold on some bilinear groups \cite{ECRYPT:Ver13}. Furthermore, from Joux seminal work many open problems have been solved using bilinear groups, being \emph{identity based encryption} \cite{C:BonFra01} the more outstanding example, and many new applications have been found (a number of this applications can be found the survey of Dutta et al.~\cite{EPRINT:DutBarSar04a}). 

\subsection{Definition}

\begin{definition}[Bilinear Groups] \footnote{While the usual notation for the target group has been multiplicative, we write it in additive notation. The reason is just to elude cumbersome expressions in the exponent.}
Let $\GG_1$ and $\GG_2$ be cyclic groups of prime order $q$ and $\mathcal{P}_s$ the generator of $\GG_s$, $s\in\{1,2\}$, and $\GG_T$ be another cyclic group of order $q$. We say that $\GG_1,\GG_2,\GG_T$ form a bilinear group if there exists a map $e:\GG_1\times\GG_2\to\GG_T$ such that:
\begin{description}
\item[Bilinearity:] For all $a,b\in\Z_q$, for all $\mathcal{X}\in\GG_1$, and all $\mathcal{Y}\in\GG_2$
$$
e(a\mathcal{X},b\mathcal{Y})=ab\cdot e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}),
$$
\item[Non-degeneracy:] If $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}\neq0$, then $e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})\neq 0$,
\item[Computability:] $e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ is efficiently computable.
\end{description} 
\end{definition} 

The first property says that $e$ allows to ``homomorphically'' compute degree 2 expressions in the field $(\Z_q,+,\cdot)$. Since any $\mathcal{X}$ can be written as $x\mathcal{P}_1$, where $x$ is some element of $\Z_q$ (and the same can be done in $\GG_2$), $e(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})=xy\cdot e(\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2)$. Non-degeneracy says that $e$ is does not map everything to 0. While the third property says that computing $e$ is practical, the reality is that it is still an expensive operation and is one of the critical performance measures of cryptographic constructions.

Galbraith et al.~classify bilinear groups in three types \cite{DAM:GalPatSma08}:

\begin{description}
\item[Type I:] $\GG_1=\GG_2$ and also known as \emph{symmetric} groups. 
\item[Type II:] $\GG_1\neq\GG_2$ but there is an efficiently computable homomorphism $\phi:\GG_1\to\GG_2$.
\item[Type III:] $\GG_1\neq\GG_2$ and no efficiently computable homomorphism is known. Also known as \emph{asymmetric} groups.
\end{description}

Type III bilinear groups are the most attractive from the perspective
of a performance and security trade-off, specially since the recent attacks on discrete logarithms in
finite fields by Joux \cite{SAC:Joux13} and subsequent improvements.

We denote by $\ggen_a$ the probabilistic polynomial time algorithm which on input $1^{\lambda}$, where $\lambda$ is the security parameter, returns the \emph{group key} which is the description of an asymmetric bilinear group $gk:=(q,\GG_1,\GG_2,\GG_T,e,\mathcal{P}_1,\mathcal{P}_2)$, where $\GG_1,\GG_2$
and $\GG_T$ are groups of prime order $q$, the elements $\mathcal{P}_1, \mathcal{P}_2$ are generators of 
$\GG_1,\GG_2$ respectively, and $e:\GG_1\times\GG_2\to\GG_T$ is an efficiently
computable, non-degenerate bilinear map. 

\subsubsection{Implicit Representation of Group Elements}

Elements in $\GG_s$, are denoted implicitly as $[a]_s:=a \Pt_s$, where $s \in \{1,2,T\}$ and $\Pt_T:=e(\Pt_1,\Pt_2)$. 
The pairing operation will be written as a product $\cdot$, that is $[a]_1 \cdot [b]_2=[a]_1 [b]_2 =e([a]_1,[b]_2)=[ab]_T$. We sometimes abuse of notation and write $[b]_2[a]_1$ to denote $e([a]_1,[b]_2)$ (note that there is no ambiguity since $e([b]_2,[a]_1)$ is undefined). Given a matrix $\matr{T}=(t_{i,j})$, $[\matr{T}]_s$ is
the natural embedding of $\matr{T}$ in $\GG_s$, that is, the matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry
is $t_{i,j}\mathcal{P}_s$. We denote by $|\GG_s|$ the bit-size of the elements of $\GG_s$.

\subsection{The Decisional $k$-Linear Diffie-Hellman Family of Assumptions}
In type I groups the DDH assumption is easy because, as noted before, using the pairing operation one can check if $[x][y]=[z][1]$ (implicit representation in type I groups can omit the group sub-index). Boneh, Boyen, and Sacham introduced a ``DDH like'' assumption called the \emph{decisional linear Diffie-Hellman} assumption (DLin) \cite{C:BonBoySha04}, proved that is secure in the generic group model in type I groups, and that it is implied by DDH in type III groups. 

\begin{definition}[DLin assumption]
We say that the DLin assumption in $\GG_s$, $s\in\{1,2\}$, holds relative to $\G_a$ if for any adversary $\advA$
$$
\Pr\left[\begin{array}{l}
gk\gets\G_a(1^\lambda);a_1,a_2,r_1,r_2,z\gets\Z_q,b\gets\bits:\\
\advA(gk,[a_1]_s,[a_2]_s,[r_1a_1]_s,[r_2a_2],(1-b)[r_1+r_2]_s+b[z]_s)=b
\end{array}\right]\approx 1/2.
$$
\end{definition}

The DLin assumption is a natural counterpart of the DDH assumption, and one can easily replace DDH by DLin assumption (e.g.~ElGamal encryption can be easily turned into the \emph{linear encryption} scheme). Moreover, Sacham noted that  the DDH and DLin assumptions are members of an infinite family of progressively weaker assumptions called the $k$-Linear family of assumptions ($\lin{k}$) \cite{EPRINT:Shacham07a}.

\begin{definition}[$\lin{k}$ assumption]
We say that the $\lin{k}$ assumption in $\GG_s$, $s\in\{1,2\}$, holds relative to $\G_a$ if for any adversary $\advA$
\begin{align*}
&\Pr\left[\begin{array}{l}
gk\gets\G_a(1^\lambda);a_1,\ldots,a_k,r_1,\ldots,r_k,z\gets\Z_q,b\gets\bits:\\
\advA(gk,[a_1]_s,\ldots,[a_k]_s,[r_1a_1]_s,\ldots,[r_ka_k]_s,(1-b)[\sum_{i=1}^k r_i]_s+b[z]_s)=b
\end{array}\right]\\
&\approx 1/2.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

Thereby, the DDH assumption is the $\lin{1}$ assumption, DLin is $\lin{2}$, and it can be proved that $\lin{(k+1)}$ is weaker than $\lin{k}$.
