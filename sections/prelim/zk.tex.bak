Zero-Knowledge Proofs are proofs that reveal nothing beyond their validity. Since their introduction by Goldreich et al.~\cite{GolMicRac89}, Zero-nowledge proofs have played a central role in cryptography and complexity theory from both the theoretical side --it have been the inspiration of \emph{Probabilistic Checkable Proofs} and the groundbreaking results on \emph{Hardness of Approximation}-- and the practical side --applications ranges from \emph{Multi-Party Computation} to \emph{Electronic voting} and \emph{E-comerce}.

In a Zero-Knowledge proof a \emph{prover} $\algP$ in possession of a secret $w$ wants to convince a \emph{verifier} $\algV$ that some statement $x$ is true, namely that $x$ belongs to some language $\Lang$. To do so the prover and the verifier engage on an \emph{interactive protocol}: the prover starts with a message $a_1$, the verifier answers with $b_1$, and so on. At the end the verifier outputs a bit $b\in\bits$ indicating whether it rejects or accepts the proofs.

There are two basic requirements for a Zero-Knowledge proof: \emph{Completeness}, which says that the prover should be succesful when convincing the verifier about a true statement, and \emph{Soundness}, which says that the verifier rejects false statements with \emph{high probability}. There is also a third requirement which  gives the name to Zero-Knowledge proofs and it aims to require that the verifier does not learn nothing beyond the fact that $x$ is true. This is done by requiring the existence of an efficient algorithm $\algS$, the simulator, which, for any true statement, it is able to construct a \emph{transcript} of the interactive execution of $\algP$ and $\algV$ even without knowing any secret $w$.
A weaker variant of a Zero-Knowledge proof is a \emph{Witness-Indistinguishable Proof}, this proofs are not necessarily simulatable and only guarantee to reveal the same information when using two different secrets $w,w'$. 

The focus of this work is \emph{Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs} (NIZK), where the prover sends a single message, the \emph{proof}, to the verifier. Since their introduction by Blum et al.~\cite{STOC:BluFelMic88}, it was known that a ``pre-shared'' information, knwon as the \emph{Common Reference String} (CRS), allows to construct NIZK proof systems (later it was shown a necessary condition if the statement is not trivial \cite{JC:GolOre94}). Thereby, the simulator is allowed to simulate the CRS and thus is able to compute \emph{trapdoors} associated to it. The knowledge of such trapdoors enhance the posibilites of $\algS$ of succesfully simulate proofs.

In this work we will use two different definitions of NIZK: \emph{Composable} NIZK \cite{EC:GroSah08} and  \emph{Quasi-Adaptive} NIZK \cite{AC:JutRoy13}. Both deals with the case when the statement is \emph{randomized}, say $x$ it is not true or false \emph{per se} but depends on how the CRS was sampled. Concretely, the CRS might contain the group key $gk$ defining a bilinear group and, if the statement is true if $x$ is an element of $\GG_1$ and some additional property holds, it might be the case that for some choices of th group key $x$ is not even a well formed group element. Quasi-Adaptive NIZK goes even furhter, the language might also depend on group constants defined in the CRS. In this case the Zero-Knowkedge definition is more complex since knwoledge of the asociated discrete logs might trivialize the construction of a simulator.

\subsection{Composable Witness-Indistinguishability and Zero-Knowledge}
The following definitions are taken from \cite{SIAMJC:GroSah12}.

\begin{definition}[Group dependant languages] Let $\mathcal{R}$ be an efficiently computable ternary relation.
For triplets $(gk, x, w)\in \mathcal{R}$ we call $gk$ the group key, $x$ the statement, and $w$ the witness.
Given some $gk$, we let $\Lang$ be the language consisting of statements $x$ that have a
witness $w$ so $(gk, x, w) \in \mathcal{R}$. For a relation that ignores $gk$ this is, of course, the
standard definition of an NP-language. We will be more interested in the case where
$gk$ describes a bilinear group, though.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Composable NIZK proof system] We say that $(\algK,\algP,\algV)$ is a composable NIZK proof system if

\subsection{Quasi-Adaptive Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs}
A Quasi-Adaptive NIZK proof system \cite{AC:JutRoy13} enables
to prove membership in a language defined by a relation $\R_\rho$, which in turn is completely determined by some parameter
$\rho$ sampled from a distribution $\dist_\gk$.
We say that $\dist_\gk$ is \emph{witness samplable} if there exists an efficient
algorithm that samples $(\rho,\omega)$ from a distribution $\dist_\gk^{\mathsf{par}}$ such that $\rho$ is distributed according to $\dist_\gk$, and membership of $\rho$
in the \emph{parameter language} $\Lang_\mathsf{par}$ can be efficiently verified with $\omega$.
While the Common Reference String can be set based on $\rho$, the zero-knowledge simulator is required to be a single probabilistic polynomial time
algorithm that works for the whole collection of relations $\R_\gk$. 

A tuple of algorithms $(\algK_0,\algK_1,\algP,\algV)$ is called a QA-NIZK proof system for witness-relations
$\R_\gk = \{\R_\rho\}_{\rho \in \mathrm{sup}(\dist_\gk)}$
with parameters sampled from a distribution $\dist_\gk$ over associated parameter language
$\Lang_\mathsf{par}$, if there exists a probabilistic polynomial time simulator $(\algS_1, \algS_2)$,
such that for all non-uniform PPT adversaries $\advA_1$, $\advA_2$, $\advA_3$ we have:

\begin{description}
\item[Quasi-Adaptive Completeness:]
$$\Pr\begin{bmatrix*}[l]
    \gk \gets \algK_0(1^\lambda);
    \rho \gets \dist_\gk;
    \psi \gets \algK_1(\gk, \rho);
    (x, w) \gets \advA_1(\gk, \psi);\\
    \pi \gets \algP(\psi, x, w) :
        \algV(\psi, x, \pi) = 1 \text{ if } \R_\rho(x, w)
\end{bmatrix*} = 1.$$
\item[Computational Quasi-Adaptive Soundness:]
$$\Pr\begin{bmatrix*}[l]
    \gk \gets \algK_0(1^\lambda);
    \rho \gets \dist_\gk;
    \psi \gets \algK_1(\gk, \rho); \\
    (x, \pi) \gets \advA_2(\gk, \psi) :
        \algV(\psi, x, \pi) = 1 \text{ and } \neg (\exists w : \R_\rho(x, w))
\end{bmatrix*} \approx 0.$$ 
\item[Perfect Quasi-Adaptive Zero-Knowledge:]
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Pr[
    \gk \gets \algK_0(1^\lambda);
    \rho \gets \dist_\gk;
    \psi \gets \algK_1(\gk, \rho):
        \advA_3^{\algP(\psi,\cdot, \cdot)}(\gk,\psi) = 1]
=\;\;\;\\
\Pr[
    \gk \gets \algK_0(1^\lambda);
    \rho \gets \dist_\gk;
    (\psi,\tau) \gets \algS_1(\gk, \rho):
        \advA_3^{\algS(\psi,\tau,\cdot,\cdot)}(\gk,\psi)=1]
\end{eqnarray*}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $\algP(\psi, \cdot, \cdot)$ emulates the actual prover. It takes input $(x,w)$ and outputs a 
proof $\pi$ if $(x,w)\in\R_\rho$. Otherwise, it outputs $\perp$.
\item $\algS(\psi,\tau, \cdot, \cdot)$ is an oracle that takes input $(x,w)$. It outputs a simulated proof
$\algS_2(\psi,\tau, x)$ if $(x, w) \in \R_\rho$ and $\perp$ if $(x, w) \notin \R_\rho$.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}
Note that $\psi$ is the CRS in the above definitions.
We assume that $\psi$ contains an encoding of $\rho$, which is thus available to $\algV$.

For witness samplable distributions, a stronger notion of soundness, where the adversary has also access to a witness of the parameter $\rho$, is defined in the full version of \cite{AC:GonHevRaf15}.

\item[Computational Quasi-Adaptive Strong Soundness:]
$$\Pr\begin{bmatrix*}[l]
    \gk \gets \algK_0(1^\lambda);
    (\rho,\omega) \gets \dist_\gk^\mathsf{par};
    \psi \gets \algK_1(\gk, \rho); \\
    (x, \pi) \gets \advA_2(\gk, \omega,\psi) :
        \algV(\psi, x, \pi) = 1 \text{ and } \neg (\exists w : \R_\rho(x, w))
\end{bmatrix*} \approx 0.$$
