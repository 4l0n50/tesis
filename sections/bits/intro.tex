In this chapter we solve the problem of constructing a \emph{constant-size proof} that a set of commitments open to elements of the set $\bits$.
Althought solutions for this problem can be easyly derived from general results of contant-size NIZK for any NP language \cite{EC:GGPR13,AC:DFGK14,EC:Groth16}, they would rely on strong and controversial assumptions, namely non-falsifiable assumptions. Therefore, it is an open question to solve the problem of finding constant-size proofs for this language relying only on standard falsifiable assumptions. 

Instead of thinking on a set of individual commitments to integers, one can think on a single commitment $[\vecb{c}]_1$ to an element of $\Z_q^n$, for some $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Thereby, we can distinguish two different cases:

\begin{description}
\item[Perfectly Binding Commitment:] The commitment defines a unique vector $\vecb{x}\in\Z_q^n$. It must hold that $|\vecb{c}|\geq n$.
\item[Non-binding Commitment:] In this case $[\vecb{c}]_1$ can be opened to many values and $|\vecb{c}|\leq n$.
\end{description}

Note that in the second case it is not clear what a proof of membership in $\Lang_{ck,\sfbits}^n$ means. For example, if we use \emph{Multi-Pedersen} commitment, where a commitment to $\vecb{x}\in\Z_q^n$ is $[c]_1=\sum_{i\in[n]}x_i[g_i]_1+r[g_{n+1}]_1\in\GG_1$, each $[c]_1$ can be opened to any value and thus $\Lang_{ck,\sfbits}^n$ is trivial. Although it do makes sense to do a \emph{Proof of Knowledge} that $[c]\in\Lang_{gk,\sfbits}^n$, where one can even extract a witness, we do not know how construct such proof system using only falsifiable assumptions.

For this reason, in \cite{AC:GonHevRaf15} we firstly concentrated in the perfectly binding case, Groth-Sahai commitments and other perfectly-binding scheme with reuse of randomeness. We find two interesting applications of this proof system: more efficient signature schemes, with emphasis on the case of \emph{Ring Signatures}, and more efficient \emph{Threshold Groth-Sahai proofs}.
 
Later, in \cite{ACNS:GonRaf16}, we tackle the non-binding case for a commitment scheme which is an ``hybrid'' between Multi-Pedersen commitments and Groth-Sahai commitments. We call this commitment scheme \emph{Extended Multi-Pedersen commitments}. 
While we realized that the techniques from the first work implicitly build a proof system for non-binding commitments, we did not know how to prove soundness (and we still do not know) for the specific distribution of the commiment keys used there. In turn, in the latter work we proved soundness for a specific set of distributions and showed that it imply previous results and also have more ing applications: \emph{Aggregated Set-Membership Proofs}, \emph{Range Proofs}, and \emph{Proofs of Correctness of a Shuffle}.

In Sect. \ref{sec:bits-binding} we describe our results for the perfectly binding case and the applications, and in Sect. \ref{sec:bits-non-binding} we describe our results for the non-binding case.
