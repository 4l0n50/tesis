In this section we construct a constant-size proof that a non-binding commitment to a vector from $\Z_q^n$ opens to an element from $\bits^n$. In this case the size of the commitment is independent of $n$. 

In Section~\ref{sec:ext-mp} we introduce a new commitment scheme, \emph{extended multi-Pedersen commitments}, which is an ``hybrid'' between Groth-Sahai commitments and multi-Pedersen commitments.
Then, in Section~\ref{sec:bits-scheme-nb}, we construct a QA-NIZK argument that an extended multi-Pedersen commitment opens to an element from $\bits^n$. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:matr-bits} we show how to give a constant-size proof that many multi-Pedersen commitments open to bit-strings. Using this last proof system one can derive our construction for the perfectly-binding case as a simple corollary and, further, it helps to construct the efficient constructions from Chapter \ref{sec:shuf-rp}.
