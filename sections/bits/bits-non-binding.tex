In this section we address the problem of proving, with a constant-size proof,  that a non-binding commitment in $\Gr$ opens to a bit-string of length $n$. We remark that in this case the size of the commitment is independent of $n$. 

In Sect. \ref{sec:ext-mp} we introduce a new commitment scheme, \emph{Extended Multi-Pedersen Commitments}, which is an ``hybrid'' between Groth-Sahai commitments and Multi-Pedersen commitments.
Then, in Sect. \ref{sec:bits-scheme-nb}, we construct a QA-NIZK argument that an extended Multi-Pedersen commmitment opens to a bit-string. Finally, in Sect. \ref{sec:matr-bits} we show how to give a constant-size proof that many Multi-Pedersen commitments open to bit-strings. Using this last proof system one can derive our construction for the perfectly-binding case as a simple corollary and, further, it helps to construct the efficient constructions from Chapter \ref{sec:shuf-rp}.
