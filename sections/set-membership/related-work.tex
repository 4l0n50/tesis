\subsubsection{Zero Knowledge Set Membership Arguments.}
Camenisch et al. constructed $\Theta(1)$ interactive Zero-Knowledge set membership arguments using Boneh-Boyen Signatures, and they prove them secure under the $q$-SDH assumption \cite{AC:CamChaShe08}. Bayer and Groth constructed $\Theta(\log |S|)$ interactive Zero-Knowledge arguments for polynomial evaluation, which can be used to construct set membership arguments, relying only on the discrete logarithm assumption \cite{EC:BayGro13}.
However, none of the previous constructions have addressed the problem of aggregating many proofs, and a direct use of them will end up with a proof of size $\Omega(n)$.

\subsubsection{NIZK Shuffle and Range Arguments.}
The most efficient NIZK Shuffle argument under falsifiable assumptions is the one from Groth and Lu \cite{AC:GroLu07}, which works for BBS ciphertexts. The proof size is linear in the number of ciphertexts, specifically $15n + 120$ group elements in Type I groups. The security of their construction relies on two assumptions: the \emph{Paring Product Assumption} and the \emph{Permutation Pairing Assumption}. The first assumption is a $\dist_{n,2}\mbox{-}\kermdh$ Assumption, when $\matr{M}\gets\dist_{n,2}$ is of the form $\matr{M}^\top:=\pmatri{x_1,\ldots,x_n\\x_1^2,\ldots,x_n^2}$ for $x_i\gets\Z_q$, $i\in[n]$. The second assumption is proven generically secure in \cite{AC:GroLu07} but it seems to be unrelated with any other assumption.

Using non-falsifiable assumptions (i.e. Knowledge of Exponent type of assumptions), Lipmaa and Zhang \cite{SCN:LipZha12} constructed a shuffle argument with communication $6n\sG+11\sH$, and recently Fauzi and Lipmaa  \cite{EPRINT:FauLip15} constructed a shuffle argument with communication $(5n+2)\sG+2n\sH$.

Rial, Kohlweiss, and Preneel constructed a range argument in $[0,2^n-1]$ with communication $\Theta(\frac{n}{\log n -\log\log n})$ and prove it secure under the $q$-HSDH assumption \cite{PAIRING:RiaKohPre09}. One might get rid of the $q$-HSDH assumption replacing the \emph{P-signature} with any \emph{Structure Preserving Signature}, but, since the proof requires $\frac{n}{\log n-\log \log n}$ Groth-Sahai proofs of satisfiability of the signature's verification equation and the signature's size is at least 7 group elements \cite{C:KilPanWee15}, the resulting protocol is far less efficient.
Using non-falsifiable assumptions, Chaabouni, Lipmaa, and Zhang constructed a range argument with constant communication~\cite{FC:ChaLipZha12}. 

A detailed comparison of our Shuffle and Range arguments with the most efficient constructions under falsifiable assumptions is depicted in Table \ref{table:eff}.
